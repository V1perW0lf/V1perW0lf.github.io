<h1> Ethics </h1>

<p> Each culture has a set of rules that determines the boundaries of behavior that is acceptable. These rules are expressed in small statements that all fit together in order to form the moral code that a society lives by. Ethics is a set of beliefs about right and wrong behavior within a society (Reynolds 3). Many ethical concepts are similar or the same across all cultures. But while certain actions such as killing or cheating are considered unethical, opinions about what exactly ethical behavior is can vary wildly. </p>
