<h1> Ethics </h1>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> Each culture has a set of rules that determines the boundaries of behavior that is acceptable. These rules are expressed in small statements that all fit together in order to form the moral code that a society lives by. Ethics is a set of beliefs about right and wrong behavior within a society (Reynolds 3). Many ethical concepts are similar or the same across all cultures. But while certain actions such as killing or cheating are considered unethical, opinions about what exactly ethical behavior is can vary wildly. For example, in many places in the middle east women are not allowed to vote. This is common and accepted there as a norm. However, when someone from the United States hears about this it sounds almost unreal due to the fact that some women have seen women voting all of their lives.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> People that study ethics come to the decision that ethical decision making is theory based and that those theories can be classified. Virtue ethics is one of these theories and part of the idea behind it is that there are certain virtues that are praiseworthy and appropriate in general or in a certain scenario. Another one of these ethical theories is the natural law theory. Which states that one may discover principles of good and bad which can influence our actions in a way that will lead to human fulfillment. This suggests that humans have the ability within themselves for bringing their potential into fruition. Another ethical theory to think about is consequentialism which involves how right or wrong an action is by judging it by the consequences it produces. A version of consequentialism is utilitarianism which suggests one should act in such a way so that the greatest good is achieved for everyone involved.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> Ethics have made quite the impact in the IT environment. There have even been whole organizations who have created their own code of ethics for not only themselves but for those who may be lacking and in need of guidance. One such example of an organization is IEEE. Their first bullet point in their code of ethics says this: they agree “to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment”. Another such organization with a code of ethics is ACM and their first ethical principle is: “Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing”. Without organizations such as these creating codes of ethics for all to read, IT environments may not be as ethical as they are today. IT businesses certainly need ethics, otherwise their employees could leak information, cause security issues, and even perform insider trading. </p>

<h1> Internet of Things </h1>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> The Internet of Things is a concept that we brought onto ourselves by simply advancing our technology to the point that we began to need a term that explains exactly how interconnected all of our devices are today. The term deals with any device we have that can connect to the internet such as cellphones, smart watches, and even coffee makers. With the number of devices with internet connections steadily increasing, there will come a time where one would be hard pressed to find an electronic device in their home without one. An analyst firm Gartner says that “by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices”. Anything with that many connections, especially one that humans have direct control over, is going to be extremely influential and important in our society. With all these connections, many new exciting and possibly scary opportunities arise. One example is if the traffic on your current route is really bad, your phone could be able to send a text to whoever you agreed to meet with that you will be late. Another example is that someone who is being stalked could easily have their current location tracked at all times due to their cellphone or smartwatch. So, while the Internet of Things can certainly be used for efficiency and for the betterment of human kinds, there are also some scenarios that we need to look out for and attempt to prevent against. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> With the Internet of Things dealing with all things electronic and of course all things internet, it is obvious how much of an impact it can and does have on IT businesses. One direction one could look for an example of how much of an impact is has already had is IEEE. IEEE has its own Internet of Things initiative in which it “serves as a home for the global community of engineering and technology professionals in industry, academia, and government working in related technologies”. ACM has published a journal detailing the Internet of Things in which they “publish novel research contributions and experience reports in several research domains whose synergy and interrelations enable the IoT vision.” Aside from initiatives such as IEEE’s and ACM’s journal, it is clear that the Internet of Things has a large impact on IT businesses due simply to the fact that many IT businesses have incorporated many devices that are connected to the Internet of Things. Obvious devices such as the computers they work on, their servers, and their cellphones. As well as devices that may not be as obvious such as satellites, cameras, and tracking devices. Because of how much the Internet of Things influences IT businesses, those businesses should take care to tread lightly and implement proper security measures in order to maintain the privacy of not only the companies sacred information but also the privacy of their employees. </p>
