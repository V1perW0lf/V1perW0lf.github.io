<h1> Ethics </h1>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> Each culture has a set of rules that determines the boundaries of behavior that is acceptable. These rules are expressed in small statements that all fit together in order to form the moral code that a society lives by. Ethics is a set of beliefs about right and wrong behavior within a society (Reynolds 3). Many ethical concepts are similar or the same across all cultures. But while certain actions such as killing or cheating are considered unethical, opinions about what exactly ethical behavior is can vary wildly. For example, in many places in the middle east women are not allowed to vote. This is common and accepted there as a norm. However, when someone from the United States hears about this it sounds almost unreal due to the fact that some women have seen women voting all of their lives.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> People that study ethics come to the decision that ethical decision making is theory based and that those theories can be classified. Virtue ethics is one of these theories and part of the idea behind it is that there are certain virtues that are praiseworthy and appropriate in general or in a certain scenario. Another one of these ethical theories is the natural law theory. Which states that one may discover principles of good and bad which can influence our actions in a way that will lead to human fulfillment. This suggests that humans have the ability within themselves for bringing their potential into fruition. Another ethical theory to think about is consequentialism which involves how right or wrong an action is by judging it by the consequences it produces. A version of consequentialism is utilitarianism which suggests one should act in such a way so that the greatest good is achieved for everyone involved.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> Ethics have made quite the impact in the IT environment. There have even been whole organizations who have created their own code of ethics for not only themselves but for those who may be lacking and in need of guidance. One such example of an organization is IEEE. Their first bullet point in their code of ethics says this: they agree “to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment”. Another such organization with a code of ethics is ACM and their first ethical principle is: “Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing”. Without organizations such as these creating codes of ethics for all to read, IT environments may not be as ethical as they are today. IT businesses certainly need ethics, otherwise their employees could leak information, cause security issues, and even perform insider trading. </p>
