<h1> Ethics </h1>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> Each culture has a set of rules that determines the boundaries of behavior that is acceptable. These rules are expressed in small statements that all fit together in order to form the moral code that a society lives by. Ethics is a set of beliefs about right and wrong behavior within a society (Reynolds 3). Many ethical concepts are similar or the same across all cultures. But while certain actions such as killing or cheating are considered unethical, opinions about what exactly ethical behavior is can vary wildly. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"> People that study ethics come to the decision that ethical decision making is theory based and that those theories can be classified. Virtue ethics is one of these theories and part of the idea behind it is that there are certain virtues that are praiseworthy and appropriate in general or in a certain scenario. Another one of these ethical theories is the natural law theory. Which states that one may discover principles of good and bad which can influence our actions in a way that will lead to human fulfillment. Another ethical theory to think about is consequentialism which involves how right or wrong an action is by judging it by the consequences it produces. </p>
